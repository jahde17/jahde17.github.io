<p>Hello! I'm Jahde and I am an author/artist. I crave anything artistic like writing stories or drawing or playing music, but for some reason, I also like to code. Coding is hard and very much intimidating, but I'm trying to make it seem less scary than it is. This blog is dedicated to everyone who started coding or wants to code that feels like they have no place being in the tech business. Well, I am here to prove that anyone can learn how to code, and it's something that can satisfy even the most non-techy person out there. </p>
